## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

- **Check if the bug has already been reported** by searching the GitHub Issues.
- **Open a new issue** if you can't find an existing one.
- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue.
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see and why** and what you actually saw.
- **Include screenshots** if the problem is UI-related.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

- **Check if there's already a similar suggestion** in the GitHub Issues.
- **Use a clear and descriptive title**.
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement**.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most OlivERP users.

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **If you've added code that should be tested, add tests**.
3. **If you've changed APIs, update the documentation**.
4. **Ensure the test suite passes**.
5. **Make sure your code lints** (`pnpm astro check`).
6. **Submit a Pull Request** with a comprehensive description of your changes.

### Developing with Demo Mode

If you want to contribute to the UI or frontend logic without configuring a backend or creating an account, you can use the **Demo Mode**.

Simply skip step 3 of the installation (skip the `.env` file credentials). The application will detect the absence of Convex credentials and automatically populate the dashboard with realistic mock data, allowing you to develop and test your changes immediately.


## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### TypeScript Styleguide

- Use TypeScript for all logic.
- Prefer functional components and hooks.
- Define types/interfaces for all data structures (see `src/types/`).
- Use `any` only as a last resort.

### Tailwind CSS Styleguide

- Use Tailwind 4 utility classes (integrated via Vite).
- Avoid writing custom CSS in `.astro` files unless absolutely necessary.
- Use the project's color palette (indigo/emerald/rose accents) to keep the UI consistent.
